timings
=======

Small set of PHP scripts to display timings of computations

overview
========

The following data is already contained as example:

The folder 'data' contains sample data from groebner basis computations using parallelGBC.
The folder 'files' contains sample profile data (systems, problems, ...)
The folder 'tables' contains sample tables for the representation of the tables.
The folder 'templates' contains a first template to output a table in html, (LaTeX will follow?)
The folder 'modes' contains the controller for the different output modes.

index.php is currently configured to deliever the file via a webserver.
setup.php is hopefully self-explaining;-)
